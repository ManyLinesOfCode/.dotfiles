These are the configuration files I use on my Arch Linux system.

# Dependencies

Lines `53` to `56` of the the Qtile config lay out keyboard shortcuts that launch certain programs. For out-of-the-box use, you'll have to install those packages.

The config files for Qtile and Alacritty also make use of the [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono) font.

# To-do

- Write a setup script that installs the required packages and fonts for the configs.
