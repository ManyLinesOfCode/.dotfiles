These are the configuration files I use on my Arch Linux system.

# Configs

This repository contains configurations for the following:

- [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/)
- [Alaritty](https://alacritty.org/)
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

# Dependancies

The qtile config lays out keyboard shortcuts that launch certain programs. As such, the following packages are required for out-of-the-box use:

- Firefox (`firefox`)
- Discord (`discord`)
- Visual Studio Code (`visual-studio-code-bin`)
- PCManFM File Manager (`pcmanfm`)

The config files for Qtile and Alacritty also make use of the [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono) font.
